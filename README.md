# NPCI-blockchain-Playground-Challenge-Payroll-System-with-Batch-Payment-Processing
This project is a smart contract built using Solidity to manage payrolls and batch payments. It allows an employer to add employees, fund the company account, and process payments to all employees at once. The payments are handled in a secure manner with necessary checks to avoid attacks such as reentrancy.
